        <p>
          "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as
          far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and
          cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by
          extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free
          alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment.
          In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all
          products derived wholly or partly from animals ."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >There are many ways to embrace vegan living. Yet one thing all
            vegans have in common is</strong
          ><strong
            >a plant-based diet avoiding all animal foods such as meat
            (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and Honey - as
            well as avoiding animal-derived materials, products tested on
            animals and places that use animals for entertainment.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <h2>History<br /></h2>
        <p>
          Although the vegan diet was defined early on in The Vegan Society's
          beginnings in 1944, it was as late as 1949 before Leslie J Cross
          pointed out that the society lacked a definition of veganism. He
          suggested “[t]he principle of the emancipation of animals from
          exploitation by man”. This is later clarified as “to seek an end to
          the use of animals by man for food, commodities, work, hunting,
          vivisection, and by all other uses involving exploitation of animal
          life by man”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The society was first registered as a charity in August 1964 but its
          assets were later transferred to a new charity when it also became a
          limited company in December 1979. The definition of veganism and the
          charitable objects of the society were amended and refined over the
          years. By winter 1988 the current definition was in use - although the
          phrasing has changed slightly over the years.
        </p>
        <h2>So what do vegans eat?<br /></h2>
        <p>
          A great deal - you'll soon find a whole new world of exciting foods
          and flavours opening up to you. A vegan diet is richly diverse and
          comprises all kinds of fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, seeds, beans
          and pulses - all of which can be prepared in endless combinations that
          will ensure you're never bored. From curry to cake, pasties to pizzas,
          all your favourite things can be suitable for a vegan diet if they're
          made with plant-based ingredients. Check out our vegan
          <a href="/pages/recipes/recipes.html">recipes</a> for ideas.
        </p>
        <h2>It's not just about diet</h2>

        <p>
          Vegans avoid exploiting animals for any purpose, with compassion being
          a key reason many choose a vegan lifestyle. From accessories and
          clothing to makeup and bathroom items, animal products and products
          tested on animals are found in more places than you might expect.
          Fortunately nowadays there are affordable and easily-sourced
          alternatives to just about everything. With over 61,000 products and
          services registered with our Vegan Trademark alone, living a vegan
          lifestyle has never been easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently all medicine in the UK must be tested on animals before it
          is deemed safe for human use, but please note:
          <strong
            >The Vegan Society DOES NOT recommend you avoid medication
            prescribed to you by your doctor </strong
          >- a vegan who is looking after themselves the best they can is an
          asset to the movement. What you can do is ask your GP or pharmacist to
          provide you, if possible, with medication that does not contain animal
          products such as gelatine or lactose. For more information visit the
          <a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk" target="_blank"
            >medicines website</a
          >, which contains information on medicines prescribed in the UK,
          including ingredients lists.

        <h3>Medical charities<br /></h3>
        <p>
          If you're a medical charity supporter you may wish to

            href="https://www.animalaid.org.uk/the-issues/our-campaigns/animal-experiments/health-charities-animal-testing/"
            target="_blank"
            >check whether your chosen charity performs tests on animals</a
          >. There are many charities that don't currently conduct animal tests
          and many vegans prefer donating to charities that actively seek
          alternative methods of testing.
        </p>
        <h3>Entertainment<br /></h3>
        <p>
          Vegans choose not to support animal exploitation in any form and so
          avoid visiting zoos or aquariums, or taking part in dog or horse
          racing. A great alternative is visiting and supporting animal
          sanctuaries that provide safe and loving homes for rescued animals.

            <h2>For the animals</h2>
            <p>
              Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for
              becoming vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their
              decision to go vegan and stay vegan. Having emotional attachments
              with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe that
              all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. Specifics
              aside, avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways
              you can take a stand against animal cruelty and animal
              exploitation everywhere.
            </p>
            <h2>For your health</h2>

            <p>
              Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition
              and cooking, and improve your diet. Getting your nutrients from
              plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting
              options like whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables,
              which are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.
            </p>
            <h2>For the environment<br /></h2>
            <p>
              From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all
              aware of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective
              things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is to
              avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow
              flatulence!
            </p>
            <h3>Why is meat and dairy so bad for the environment?</h3>
            <p>
              The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy
              burden on the environment - from crops and water required to feed
              the animals, to the transport and other processes involved from
              farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat
              production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat
              loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of
              5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals
              in Europe. This land contributes to developing world malnutrition
              by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for animal
              feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand,
              considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to
              sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to veganism one of the
              easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our
              impact on the environment. For more on how veganism is the way
              forward for the environment.
            </p>
            <h2>For people</h2>
            <p>
              Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to
              looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more
              sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet
              requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and
              dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a
              myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never
              been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living.
              Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an
              individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other
              resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against
              inefficient food systems which disproportionately affect&nbsp;the
              poorest people all over the world.

            <h3>Why vegetarian isn't enough</h3>
            <p>
              The suffering caused by the dairy and egg industry is possibly
              less well publicised than the plight of factory farmed animals.
              The production of dairy products necessitates the death of
              countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as
              well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk
              production decreases. Similarly, in the egg industry, even
              'ethical' or 'free range' eggs involve the killing of the
              'unnecessary' male chicks when just a day old.
            </p>
            <h3>Ethical meat?<br /></h3>
            <p>
              It's tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical,
              that our 'food animals' have lived full, happy lives and that they
              have experienced no pain or fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the
              sad truth is that all living creatures (even those labelled 'free
              range' or 'organic') fear death, just as we do. No matter how they
              are treated when alive, they all experience the same fear when it
              comes to slaughter.
            </p>
            <h2>The good news<br /></h2>
            <p>
              The good news is there IS something we can do about it. Every time
              we shop or order food in a restaurant - every time we eat - we can
              choose to help these animals. Every time we make the switch from
              an animal product to a vegan one we are standing up for farmed
              animals everywhere. Going vegan is easier than ever before with
              veganism becoming increasingly mainstream as more and more people
              from all walks of life discover the benefits of living this way.

              Whatever brought you as far as this page, you've already taken the
              all-important first step on your vegan journey. Here are some
              tried and tested tips to help this exciting process go smoothly.
            </p>
            <h2>Take it slow</h2>
            <p>
              Keep your end goal in mind, but go at your own pace. Some people
              manage to go vegan overnight and if that's the right approach for
              you, fantastic. But don't be concerned if you feel you need more
              time. Like any other lifestyle change, going vegan not only takes
              getting used to, but it takes time to determine what will work
              best for you. It's not a one size fits all experience and there
              are numerous approaches you can take.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making small changes to your everyday meals is one of the easiest
              ways to increase the amount of plant-based foods in your diet. You
              could start by removing meat or dairy one day a week and go from
              there. Or you could try changing one meal at a time, having vegan
              breakfasts during your first week, adding a vegan lunch during
              week two and so on. You could even try changing one product at a
              time by swapping cow's milk for almond or soya milk or butter for
              coconut oil or margarine. There's a plant-based alternative for
              almost every type of food you can think of, so you don't have to
              miss out on any of your favourite foods.

            <h2>Do it right<br /></h2>
            <p>
              Make sure you don't miss out on essential nutrients. Just because
              you're vegan that doesn't mean you're 100% healthy, as there are
              vegan versions of almost every type of junk food you can think of.
              As long as you eat a wide variety of tasty plant foods, planning a
              healthy diet that incorporates all the vitamins and nutrients you
              need will be a breeze. Check out our nutrition pages for more
              information, or seek advice from a registered dietitian.
            </p>
            <h2>Try new things</h2>
            <p>
              Treat your taste buds to new foods and new flavours. Leaving your
              food comfort zone will take you on a voyage of discovery of new
              cuisines. There are thousands of vegan recipes out there from
              every corner of the globe. Whatever your culinary preference,
              you'll encounter amazing new dishes and interesting variations on
              your old favourites. Yet you don't have to be an award-winning
              chef to achieve this. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the number
              of meals you can easily prepare from things already in your
              kitchen or local supermarket ingredients.

            <h2>Keep learning<br /></h2>
            <p>
              Remember that going vegan is a learning curve.&nbsp;To live as a
              vegan in a non-vegan world takes both courage and curiosity.
              Veganism has been around since 1944, but it’s still a relatively
              new concept to many people. It’s important you allow yourself time
              to learn about the various strands of veganism.

            <h2>Ask for help</h2>
            <p>
              >"Where can I buy vegan chocolate?" "How do I bake cakes without
              eggs?" "I don't know how to speak to my family about
              veganism!”Fear not –you're not alone. Our website is full of
              information and resources covering all of these questions and
              more. There's nothing like talking to other vegans to make your
              transition even easier.
            </p>

            <h2>Remember why</h2>
            <p>
              Keep reminding yourself of the reasons you've chosen a vegan
              lifestyle, and the benefits you've felt since going vegan. You'll
              probably find going vegan a lot easier than expected, but if you
              do have a bad day or feel this whole vegan thing is too much like
              hard work. take a deep breath and briefly reflect on your choices.
              Reading books or regularly watching informative and uplifting
              videos about veganism can help, as does keeping motivating visual
              reminders like photos of your favourite animals. Or how about
              locating your nearest animal sanctuary? Spending time with animals
              who are traditionally farmed and getting to know their wonderful
              personalities is a great way to reaffirm your commitment to
              veganism.
            </p>
            <h2>Don't give up</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe in yourself, vegan living will soon become second
              nature. There is always a better reason to stick with your
              decision than to go against it. If you're having issues with
              friends or family, don't give up! be sure to enjoy it.
